# Uncovering Audience Insights: Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis 

## 🚀Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify text data (e.g., reviews, tweets, comments) into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

## 📂Dataset:
Source: Public datasets like Amazon Products reviews.
Structure: Text data with associated sentiment labels.

Example:  
- "I loved the movie!" → Positive  
- "This was a waste of time." → Negative 

## 🛠️Methodology:
- Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, stop words, stemming/lemmatization.
- Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, or Word Embeddings.
- Model Building: ML models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

## 🏆Results:
Achieved 85–90% accuracy (depending on model and dataset).
Model performs well on clean, balanced data.
Possible improvements: use of pre-trained transformers (e.g., BERT), better hyperparameter tuning, and more data.

## 📃Conclusion:
This sentiment analysis project amply illustrates how machine learning may be utilized for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It sets the stage for use in customer feedback analysis, social media listening and beyond.
